## Tech Matters
We help social change leaders understand what tech can and canâ€™t do, and build the tech solutions behind solving a social problem. We are structured as a nonprofit organization (a 501c3 charity in the U.S.), and typically end up operating platforms for the benefit of people and organizations without internal tech capacity. However, the data of our partners belongs to them, not us! 

## Projects
* [Aselo](https://aselo.org/): A cloud-based, open-source modern contact center system for crisis response helplines that connects people in need on the platforms they use with the help they require. Aselo was originally co-designed with the global child helpline movement, building specifically for the crisis response set of use cases: counseling, referral and/or case management. Most of our national helpline users serve children, but Aselo is already in use with a gender-based-violence line and internet-related hotlines. 
* [Terraso](https://terraso.org/): A digital platform supporting locally-led landscape collaborations. Currently in active development with the involvement of a dozen of these local leadership teams in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.
